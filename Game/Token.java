 * Summary: The Token class is a wrapper for the playerâ€™s token image to be called. The Token has no actions in
a game. It just is displayed on the game board space that is the location of the player during the
game. The Token does not store that space location. Instead the player stores the id of the token
and the space location of the player on the game board.
