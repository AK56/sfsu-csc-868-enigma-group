Hi All,

To run the monopoly database SQL file "make_tables_with_data_v4.sql"
--
-- Database: `monopoly`
--
-- // uncomment this line if it database does not already exist by deleting the dashes
-- CREATE DATABASE monopoly​;  
--

 
To get the MySQL database accessible in your project it needs a library added to that project.

​​In Netbeans open your project
right click the libraries folder
select add library
a popup will appear with a list of libraries
scroll down the list and click on "MySQL JDBC Driver"
click the add library button
