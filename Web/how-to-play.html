      <p class="h1">How to Play Monopoly</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h1 class="h3">Object of the game of MONOPOLY</h1>
    <p>The object of the  game of MONOPOLY is to become the wealthiest player through buying, renting and  selling property.</p>
    <h1 class="h3">Equipment in the game of MONOPOLY:    </h1>
    <ol>
      <li>game  board</li>
      <li>dice</li>
  </ol>
    <p>11 MONOPOLY tokens<br />
      32 houses<br />
      12 hotels<br />
      16 Chance cards<br />
      16 Community Chest cards<br />
      Title Deed card for each of 22  MONOPOLY properties<br />
      $15,140 in  MONOPOLY money Back to Top&gt;<br />
      Preparation for the game of  MONOPOLY:</p>
    <p>Place the  MONOPOLY game board on a table and put the Chance and Community Chest cards  face- down on their allotted spaces on the game board. Each player chooses one  MONOPOLY token to represent him/her on his travels around the game board.</p>
    <p>Each player is given $1500 divided  as follows: 2 each of $500's, $100's and $50's; 6-$20's; 5 each of<br />
      $10's, $5's and $1's.</p>
    <p>All remaining MONOPOLY money and  other MONOPOLY equipment go to the Bank.</p>
    <h1 class="h3">The Banker in MONOPOLY:</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Select as Banker  a player who will also make a good Auctioneer. If the Banker plays in the game,  he/she must keep all personal funds separate from those of the Bank. When more  than five persons play MONOPOLY, the Banker may elect to act only as Banker and  Auctioneer.</p>
    <h1 class="h3">The MONOPOLY Bank:</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Besides the Bank's  money, the MONOPOLY Bank holds the Title Deed cards and houses and hotels prior  to purchase and use by the players. The Bank pays salaries and bonuses. It  sells and auctions properties and hands out their proper Title Deed cards; it  sells houses and hotels to the players and loans money when required on  mortgages.</p>
    <p>The Bank collects  all taxes, fines, loans and interest, and the price of all MONOPOLY properties  which it sells and auctions.</p>
    <br clear="all" />
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The Bank never  &quot;goes broke&quot;. If the Bank runs out of MONOPOLY money it may issue as  much more as may be needed by merely writing on any ordinary paper.</p>
    <h1 class="h3">Game Play in MONOPOLY:</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Starting with the  Banker, each player in turn throws the dice. The player with the highest total  starts the play. He places his token on the corner of the game board marked  &quot;GO&quot;, throws the 2 dice and moves his MONOPOLY token in the direction  of the arrow, the number of spaces indicated by the dice. After he has  completed his play, the turn to play passes to the left. The MONOPOLY tokens  remain on the game board spaces occupied and proceed from that point on the  player's next turn. Two or more tokens may rest on the same space at the same  time.</p>
    <p>According to the  space which his token reaches, a player may be entitled to buy real estate or  other MONOPOLY properties, -or be obliged to pay rent, pay taxes, draw a Chance  or Community Chest card, &quot;Go to Jail&quot;, etc.</p>
    <p>If a player  throws doubles he moves his token as usual the sum of the two dice and is  subject to any privileges or penalties pertaining to the space on which he  lands. Retaining the dice, he throws again and moves his token as before. If a  player throws doubles three times in succession, he moves his token immediately  to the space marked &quot;In Jail&quot; (see JAIL).</p>
    <h1 class="h3">MONOPOLY Game Board - &quot;Go&quot;</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Each time a  player's MONOPOLY token lands on or passes over &quot;GO&quot;, whether by  throw of the dice or by drawing a card, the Banker pays him $200 salary.</p>
    <p>However, $200 is  paid only once each time around the game board. If a player, passing  &quot;GO&quot; on the throw of the dice, lands 2 spaces beyond it on  &quot;Community Chest&quot;, or 7 spaces beyond it on &quot;Chance&quot;, and  draws the card &quot;Advance to GO&quot;, he collects $200 for passing  &quot;GO&quot; the first time and another $200 for reaching it the second time  by instructions on the card.</p>
    <h1 class="h3">Buying MONOPOLY Property:</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Whenever a player  lands on an unowned MONOPOLY property he may buy that property from the Bank at  its printed price. He receives the Title Deed card showing ownership and places  it face-up in front of him.</p>
    <p>If he does not  wish to buy the MONOPOLY property it is sold at auction by the Banker to the  highest bidder. The buyer pays to the Bank the amount of the bid in cash and  receives the Title Deed card for that property. Any player, including the one  who declined the option of buying it at the printed price, may bid. Bidding may  start at any price.</p>
    <h1 class="h3">Paying Rent in MONOPOLY:</h1>
    <br clear="all" />
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>When a player  lands on MONOPOLY property owned by another player the owner collects rent from  him in accordance with the list printed on the Title Deed card applying to it.</p>
    <p>If the property  is mortgaged, no rent can be collected. When a property is mortgaged its Title  Deed card is placed face-down in front of the owner.</p>
    <p>It is an  advantage to hold all the Title Deeds in a color-group (i.e.: Boardwalk and  Park Place, - or Connecticut, Vermont and Oriental Avenues) because the owner  may then charge double rent for unimproved properties in that color-group. This  rule applies to unmortgaged MONOPOLY properties even if another property in  that color-group is mortgaged.</p>
    <p>It is even more  of an advantage to have houses or hotels on properties because rents are much higher  than for unimproved properties.</p>
    <p>The owner may not  collect his rent if he fails to ask for it before the second player following  throws the dice.</p>
    <h1 class="h3">Chance &amp; Community Chest Cards in MONOPOLY:</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>When a player  lands on either of these spaces on the MONOPOLY game board, he takes the top  card from the deck indicated, follows the instructions and returns the card  face-down to the bottom of the deck.</p>
    <p>The &quot;Get Out  of Jail Free&quot; card is held until used and then returned to the bottom of  the deck. If the player who draws it does not wish to use it he may sell it, at  any time, to another player at a price agreeable to both.</p>
    <h1 class="h3">Income Tax Rules in MONOPOLY:</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>When a player  lands on the &quot;Income Tax&quot; space of the MONOPOLY game board, he has  two options: he may estimate his tax at $200 and pay the Bank, or he may pay  10% of his total worth to the Bank. His total worth is all his cash on hand,  printed prices of mortgaged and unmortgaged MONOPOLY properties and cost price  of all buildings he owns.</p>
    <p>The player must decide which  option he will take before he adds up his total worth.</p>
    <h1 class="h3">Going to Jail in the Game of MONOPOLY:</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>You land in Jail  when... (1) your MONOPOLY token lands on the space marked &quot;Go to  Jail&quot;; (2) you draw a card marked &quot;Go to Jail&quot;; or (3) you throw  doubles three times in succession.</p>
    <p>When you are sent  to Jail you cannot collect your $200 salary in that move since, regardless of  where your token is on the game board, you must move directly into Jail. Your  turn ends when you are sent to Jail.</p>
    <br clear="all" />
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If you are not  &quot;sent&quot; to Jail but in the ordinary course of play land on that space  of the MONOPOLY game board, you are &quot;Just Visiting,&quot; you incur no  penalty, and you move ahead in the usual manner on your next turn.</p>
    <p>You get out of  Jail by... (1) throwing doubles on any of your next three turns; if you succeed  in doing this you immediately move forward the number of spaces shown by your  doubles throw; even though you had thrown doubles, you do not take another  turn; (2) using the &quot;Get Out of Jail Free&quot; card if you have it; (3)  purchasing the &quot;Get Out of Jail Free&quot; card from another player and  playing it; (4) paying a fine of<br />
      $50 before you roll the dice on either  of your next two turns.</p>
    <p>If you do not  throw doubles by your third turn, you must pay the $50 fine. You then get out  of Jail and immediately move forward the number of spaces shown by your throw.</p>
    <p>Even though you  are in Jail, you may buy and sell MONOPOLY properties, buy and sell houses and  hotels and collect rents.</p>
    <h1 class="h3">MONOPOLY Rules on Houses:</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>When you own all  the MONOPOLY properties in a color-group you may buy houses from the Bank and  erect them on those properties.</p>
    <p>If you buy one  house, you may put it on any one of those properties. The next house you buy  must be erected on one of the unimproved properties of this or any other  complete color-group you may own.</p>
    <p>The price you  must pay the Bank for each house is shown on your Title Deed card for the  MONOPOLY property on which you erect the house.</p>
    <p>The owner still  collects double rent from an opponent who lands on the unimproved properties of  his/her complete color-group.</p>
    <p>Following the  above rules, you may buy and erect at any time as many houses as your judgment  and financial standing will allow. But you must build evenly, i.e., you cannot  erect more than one house on any one property of any color-group until you have  built one house on every property of that group. You may then begin on the  second row of houses, and so on, up to a limit of four houses to a property.  For example, you cannot build three houses on one property if you have only one  house on another property of that group.</p>
    <p>As you build  evenly, you must also break down evenly if you sell houses back to the Bank  (see SELLING PROPERTY).</p>
    <h1 class="h3">MONOPOLY Rules on Hotels:</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>When a player has four houses on  each property of a complete color-group, he/she may buy a hotel</p>
    <br clear="all" />
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>from the Bank and  erect it on any MONOPOLY property of the color-group. He/she returns the four  houses from that property to the Bank and pays the price for the hotel as shown  on the Title Deed card. Only one hotel may be erected on any one property.</p>
    <h1 class="h3">Building Shortages in MONOPOLY:</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>When the Bank has  no houses to sell, players wishing to build must wait for some player to return  or sell his/her houses to the Bank before building. If there are a limited  number of houses and hotels available and two or more players wish to buy more  than the Bank has, the houses or hotels must be sold at auction to the highest  bidder.</p>
    <h1 class="h3">Rules of Selling Property in MONOPOLY:</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Unimproved  MONOPOLY properties, railroads and utilities (but not buildings) may be sold to  any player as a private transaction for any amount the owner can get; however,  no MONOPOLY property can be sold to another player if buildings are standing on  any properties of that color-group. Any buildings so located must be sold back  to the Bank before the owner can sell any property of that color-group.</p>
    <p>Houses and hotels may be sold back  to the Bank at any time for one-half the price paid for them.</p>
    <p>All houses on one  color-group may be sold at once, or they may be sold one house at a time (one  hotel equals five houses), evenly, in reverse of the manner in which they were  erected.</p>
    <h1 class="h3">Free Parking in the Game of MONOPOLY:</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>A player who  lands on the free parking space of the MONOPOLY game board does not receive any  money, property or reward of any kind. This is just a &quot;free&quot; resting  place.</p>
    <h1 class="h3">Mortgage Rules in the Game of MONOPOLY:</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Unimproved  MONOPOLY properties can be mortgaged through the Bank at any time. Before an  improved property can be mortgaged, all the buildings on all the properties of  its color-group must be sold back to the Bank at half price. The mortgage value  is printed on each Title Deed card.</p>
    <p>No rent can be  collected on mortgaged MONOPOLY properties or utilities, but rent can be  collected on unmortgaged properties in the same group.</p>
    <p>In order to lift  the mortgage, the owner must pay the Bank the amount of mortgage plus 10%  interest. When all the properties of a color-group are no longer mortgaged, the  owner may begin to buy back houses at full price.</p>
    <p>The player who  mortgages property retains possession of it and no other player may secure it  by lifting the mortgage from the Bank. However, the owner may sell this  mortgaged property to another player at any agreed price. If you are the new  owner, you may lift the mortgage at once if you wish by paying off</p>
    <br clear="all" />
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>the mortgage plus  10% interest to the Bank. If the mortgage if not lifted at once, you must pay  the Bank 10% interest when you buy the property and if you lift the mortgage  later you must pay the Bank an additional 10% interest as well as the amount of  the mortgage.</p>
    <h1 class="h3">Bankruptcy Rules in the Game of MONOPOLY:</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>You are declared  bankrupt if you owe more than you can pay either to another player or to the  Bank. If your debt is to another player, you must turn over to that player all  that you have of value and retire from the game. In making this settlement, if  you own houses or hotels, you must return these to the Bank in exchange for  money to the extent of one-half the amount paid for them; this cash is given to  the creditor. If you have mortgaged MONOPOLY property you also turn this  property over to your creditor but the new owner must at once pay the Bank the  amount of interest on the loan, which is 10% of the value of the property. The  new owner who does this may then, at his/her option, pay the principal or hold  the MONOPOLY property until some later turn, then lift the mortgage. If he/she  holds property in this way until a later turn, he/she must pay the interest  again upon lifting the mortgage.</p>
    <p>Should you owe  the Bank, instead of another player, more than you can pay (because of taxes or  penalties) even by selling off buildings and mortgaging property, you must turn  over all assets to the Bank. In this case, the Bank immediately sells by auction  all property so taken, except buildings. A bankrupt player must immediately  retire from the game. The last player left in the game wins the MONOPOLY game.</p>
    <h1 class="h3">Miscellaneous Rules of MONOPOLY:</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>MONOPOLY money  can be loaned to a player only by the Bank and then only by mortgaging  property. No player may borrow from or lend money to another player.</p>
    <h1 class="h3">Rules for a Short Game of MONOPOLY (60 to 90 minutes):</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>There are three changed rules for  this Short Game.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>During  PREPARATION for game play, the Banker shuffles the pack of Title Deed cards,  has the player to the left cut them, then deals out two, one at a time, to each  player. The players must immediately pay the Bank the printed price of each.  Game play then begins as in the regular game of MONOPOLY.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ol>
      <li>In  this short game, it is necessary to have only three houses (instead of four) on  each lot of a complete color-group before the player may buy a hotel.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Rent for a hotel remains the same  as in the regular game of MONOPOLY.</p>
    <p>The turn-in value  of a hotel is still one-half the purchase price, which in this game is one  house fewer than in the regular game of MONOPOLY.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>END OF  GAME. The first player to go bankrupt retires from game play, as in the regular  game of</li>
    </ol>
    <br clear="all" />
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>MONOPOLY;  however, when the second bankruptcy occurs, the game ends. Game play  immediately ceases, with the bankrupt player's turning over to his/her creditor  all that he/she has of value, including buildings and any other properties.  This happens whether the creditor is a rival player or the Bank.</p>
    <p>Each remaining player  then values his/her property: (1) cash on hand; (2) lots, utilities and  railroads owned, at the price printed on the board; (3) any mortgaged property  owned, at one-half the price printed on the game board; (4) houses, valued at  purchase price; (5) hotels, valued at purchase price including the value of the  three houses turned in.</p>
    <p>The richest player wins the game!</p>
    <h1 class="h3">Another Good Short Game of MONOPOLY:</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>TIME LIMIT GAME...  Before starting, agree upon a definite hour of termination, when the richest  player will be declared the winner. Before starting the game, the Banker  shuffles and cuts the Title Deed cards and deals two to each player. Players  immediately pay the Bank the price of the properties dealt to them.</p>
